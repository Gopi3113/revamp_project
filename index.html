       <p> A <strong>car</strong>, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state 
        that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over 
        cargo.[1][2] There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. The car is considered an essential part of the 
        developed economy.[citation needed]<strong>rench inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769S</strong> 
        F, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-
        powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in
         1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely a
         vailable during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, 
         are widely considered the first mass-produced[3][4] and mass-affordable[5][6][7] cars, 
        respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[8] In Europe 
        and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[9] In the 
        21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised 
        countries.[10][11]tion, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. 
       Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[17] Personal benefits 
       include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[18] Societal benefits include 
       economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, 
       societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and the generation of revenue from taxation. People's ability 
       to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[19]
